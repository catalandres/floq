# Floq

## What is this?
Floq is a set of three Apex actions that allow Flow developers to
* lock,
* unlock, and
* check the lock status of a record.

## Why "Floq"?
Floq is a [homophonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone) [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of "Flow" and "lock". It is also poorly spelt, and a great excuse to make terrible wheat puns.

## How do I use it?
1. Enable **Allow Apex code to set and remove approval process locks**, under **Process Automation Settings** in your Salesforce org.
2. Fork this repo and drop the contents of the `force-app/main/default/classes` folder in your project.
3. Build awesome things.
4. If you make any improvements to the code, [share them with the rest of the world](https://github.com/catalandres/floq/blob/main/LICENSE), and feel free to make a pull request.
